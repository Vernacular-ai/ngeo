=ngeo= is a simple text filtering tool that involves iterative human and model
assisted labeling. We sorta use the workflow for few simple cases where we are
working with short phrases.

The general workflow is like the following:

1. Make a CSV that looks like the following:
   |----------------+------------+------------+------------|
   | text           | class-true | class-pred | score-pred |
   |----------------+------------+------------+------------|
   | some text here | true       |            |            |
   | other text     | false      |            |            |
   | untagged       |            |            |            |

3. Tag data using an office suite by putting values in =class-true=.
4. Train a model using ~ngeo fit --csv-file=./data.csv --output-model=./model.pkl~
5. Populate labels in =class-pred= column along with =score-pred= as predicted by
   the model ~ngeo predict --csv-file=./data.csv --model=./model.pkl~
6. Go back in the interface and re-tag, based on confidence scores maybe, and
   repeat till you have a good amount of filtered text.
