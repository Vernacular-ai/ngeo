=ngeo= is a simple text filtering tool that involves iterative human and model
assisted labeling. We sorta use the workflow for few simple cases.

The general workflow is like the following:

1. You have a list of items to filter.
2. You make a CSV that looks like the following:

|----------------+------------+------------+------------|
| text           | class-true | class-pred | score-pred |
|----------------+------------+------------+------------|
| some text here | this-ones  |            |            |
|                |            |            |            |

3. You tag some data using an office suite by putting in =class-true=.
4. Train a model using the following:

#+begin_src shell
  ngeo fit --csv-file=./data.csv --output-model=./model.pkl
#+end_src

5. Populate labels in =class-pred= column along with =score-pred= as predicted by
   the model.

#+begin_src shell
  ngeo predict --csv-file=./data.csv --model=./model.pkl
#+end_src

6. Go back in the interface and re-tag, based on confidence scores maybe, and
   repeat till you have a good amount of filtered text.
